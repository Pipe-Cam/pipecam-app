            The property owner owns and is responsible for the sewer lateral from the foundation edge of the residence to the point at which it connects to the municipal 
            sewer main or manhole.  This means that the lateral usually extends past the property line and may travel through neighboring yards and or streets.  
            In some areas, the municipality may own the lower lateral and may or may not have restrictions. Check with the local sewer permitting authority in 
            your area to determine ownership of the line.
