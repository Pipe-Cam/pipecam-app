            (behind) the cleanout. This is the pipe that is located within the crawl space or beneath the slab, depending upon which type of foundation the subject 
            property has. One way cleanouts are common and occur with the majority of the sewer laterals that we inspect.  <RedItalic>As a result, the upstream portion of the
