// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable condition at the time of this inspection. No areas of concern were identified.

// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Monitoring and Immediate Maintenance Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the minor offset joint present in the line does not require repair at this time and should be manageable by following proper use guidelines.  The cap to the cleanout is below finished grade and the riser should be lengthened to the proper height.

// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Monitoring Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the minor offset joint present in the line that does not require repair at this time and should be manageable by following proper use guidelines.	
// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Monitoring Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the minor offset joints present in the line that do not require repair at this time and should be manageable by following proper use guidelines.	

// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Maintenance Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the root intrusions that were removed from the line immediately prior to this inspection as they will grow and change over time and require cutting.  We recommend annual maintenance to prevent future root related backups of the line.
// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in a Serviceable With Maintenance Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the root intrusion present in the line that is too small to cut at this time and should be monitored as it will grow and change over time.  The roots should be cut in approximately 9 to 12 months.  Minor offset joints are also present that that do that do not require repair at this time and should be manageable by following proper use guidelines.

// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Maintenance Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the minor offset joint, root intrusions, debris, cracks, debris and standing water present in the line.  These defects do not require repair at this time and should be manageable by following proper use guidelines.	

// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Code Correction Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the break in the pipe serving as the access into the line. This improper access will prevent proper maintenance of the line and should be corrected.

// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Immediate Maintenance Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the root intrusions and severe continuous debris present in the line that should be removed immediately. 
// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Immediate Maintenance Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the cleanout riser that is too short for the mushroom cap to function. It should be lengthened.

// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Serviceable With Immediate Repair Requirements condition at the time of this inspection due to the offset joint that requires repair.  Additional minor defects such as cracks, minor offset joints and debris are present in the line that do not require repair at this time and should be manageable by following proper use guidelines.


// // when there's going to be some sort of repair
// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Partially Serviceable condition at the time of this inspection due to the severely offset joints present in the line.  Less severe offset joints and standing water are also present in the line that do not require repair at this time and should be manageable by following proper use guidelines.
// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Partially Serviceable condition at the time of this inspection due to the multiple offset joints, break and excessive size and number of root intrusions present in the line. The number and severity of the defects indicate that this line is approaching the end of its effective life and may require replacement within the foreseeable future.  It is impossible to determine the longevity of a sewer line with a visual inspection.
// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Partially Serviceable condition at the time of this inspection due to the excessive size and number of root intrusions, debris, offsets joints, cracks, breaks, standing water. The number and severity of the defects indicate that this line has reached the end of its effective life and should be replaced.
// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Partially Serviceable condition at the time of this inspection due to the degraded condition of the Orangeburg pipe material.  The pipe is saturated and has experienced deformation where the pipe takes on an egg shape as it succumbs to pressure from the soil above and significant deflection meaning that the damp pipe material has taken on the shape of exterior items such as rocks or tree roots.  Due to the saturation of the pipe, it cannot convey waste effectively.  Additionally, roots cannot be mechanically removed because the blades of a root cutting machine will tear holes in the walls of the pipe which can cause the pipe to collapse or lose portions of the walls.
// - Orangeburg is a pipe that is constructed of a tar-impregnated wood pulp based fiberboard that was used in sewer lines as recently as the early 1970’s. Orangeburg is universally considered to be inherently defective and most municipalities will not allow repairs to be connected to Orangeburg pipe.

// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Not Serviceable condition at the time of this inspection due to the impassible offset joint and excessive roots intrusions and debris.  The offset joint requires repair.
// Serviceability: The line appeared to be in Not Serviceable condition at the time of this inspection due to the impassible unknown blockage present in the line.  As a result, approximately 25’ to 30’ of the line was not inspected and the condition is unknown.
